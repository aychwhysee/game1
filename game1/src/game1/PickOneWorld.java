    Calling this game "Pick One"
    - Two blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Simple squares (or rectangles)
    - Player-controlled rectangle at the bottom can move left or right
    - One of the two falling pieces is good, another is bad. Both pieces fall
      at the same time and pace.
    - You must only catch the good piece in order to stay alive. Catch the bad one
      or miss the good one, and the game ends.
    - Score is based on how many good piececs you catch.
    - Either start the game really fast, or speed it up as it goes? Speed up as in
      decrease the interval between each pair of blocks.

    Classes I'll need:
    - GoodBlock
    - BadBlock (will operate like GoodBlock for most of the parts)
    - PlayerBlock (player controlled)
    - PickOneWorld (main)
    - Testing class(es?)
