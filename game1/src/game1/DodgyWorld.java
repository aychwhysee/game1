    Calling this game "Dodgy"
    - Two blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Simple square or rectangle
    - Player-controlled rectangle at the bottom can move left or right
    - You must dodge both blocks. If you catch either of them, the game ends.
    - Score is based on how long you survive
    - Either start the game really fast, or speed it up as it goes? Speed up as in
      decrease the interval between each pair of blocks.
    */
    
    /*
    Classes I'll need:
    - BlockOne
    - BlockTwo (will operate like GoodBlock)
    - PlayerBlock (player controlled)
    - DodgyWorld (main)
    - Testing class(es?)
